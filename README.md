## Temporary Queries ( Mutation and Query )

`tldr` , please read

  - Please do `npm install` after clone
  - To run do `npm run start` and to test do `npm run test`
  - Currently tests is only for truthy data yet, error tests is on the way
  - To run test properly, edit `server/setupTests_template.js` to be the same as
    your `.env`, and **DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE IT INTO** `setupTests.js`
  - All results is not filtered (full data from api, but extras is removed [cuz
      its meh üôÉ])
  - Symptom diagnosis should be mutated after every iteriation with interview
    questions ~~until _should_stop: true_ ( for the best result, and maybe more accurate )~~

    **UPDATE**: temporarily gonna ask for about 3~5 questions then choose the best
    of 3 probability ( sorted and get the details about them )

    **UPDATE**: conditions met will be scanned and server will response with 
    `severity`, `prevalance`, and `hint`
  - Chat bot is only final response, so it'll check the `text` query
    for more further info you could go to the docs NLP
  - Triage level for emergency includes `emergency`, `consultation`, `self_care`
    3 of this will be explained later ( usability for client )
  - Users are optional, but feature is added ( because symptom is emergency
      hence it don't need any user at all ), but it is added to preserve
      historical conditions about your symptoms before
